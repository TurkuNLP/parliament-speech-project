### Parliament Speech Classifier

This project aims to train a classifier for predicting political affiliation based on speeches held in the Finnish Parliament. This project is part of the Semparl project: https://seco.cs.aalto.fi/projects/semparl/. The data used to train the classifier comes from Parlamenttisampo. The data is unfortunately not freely available, but I will upload it if allowed, later.

The code is divided into three parts. First, you should run the read_xml.py script, to parse the raw xml files, pick the relevant data and convert into csv files. Then, run create_datasets.py to furher process the data and prepare it for the classifier. Finally, run either classifier.py, classifier-with-comet.py or classifier-with-comet.ipynb. Comet is a machine learning platform that automatically logs and creates plots from training experiments. To run the scripts '-with-comet', you need to sign up to https://www.comet.com/site/ and fetch your personal API-key.
